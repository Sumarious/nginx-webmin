# nginx-webmin
Updated NginX Webserver Module for Webmin v1.0

This is an updated and better optimized Webmin Control Panel for the Nginx Webserver.

The original webmin module was developed by Justin D Hoffman.

I have updated it and optimized a few of it's settings for a better user experience.

Features:

Full text-area editing on config files.
Ability to setup and maintain virtual servers.
Maintain nginx configuration.
Start, reload, and stop server.

Enjoy.
